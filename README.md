Saw [this](https://www.fundraiser.com/hackathon) during weekend, just some quickie for joining the part

Simple Prototype - https://zyairelai.github.io/ponzitate/

## 1. Pay to play:
- Users deposit 1 SOL to start clicking. No free riders.
- Early adopters get higher rewards per click.

## 2. Rug Timer:
- There is a countdown timer (30 seconds).
- Everytime if someone hits the counter timer, the countdown timer resets to 30 seconds.
- If no one clicks before it hits zero, the game rugs and resets.

## 3. Leaderboards:
- Show the top clickers globally, adding a competitive edge.
- Weekly prizes for the top degenerates (from the pool).

## 4. Ponzi Jackpot:
- A small portion of each deposit adds to a grand prize jackpot, which the top clicker wins if the game rugs.
